# Localization QA Playground

## Why this exists
This project explores how localization quality, linguistic accuracy,
and UX clarity affect real product experiences. It simulates the kind
of issues that appear in localized apps and games, with a focus on
English → Italian content.

## What this project demonstrates
- Localization QA methodology
- Manual test case design
- Bug identification and severity assessment
- Linguistic and cultural judgment

## Scope
This project focuses on UI strings and microcopy rather than full
narrative localization or automated testing.

## Structure
- /strings – Source and localized content
- /test-cases – Manual QA test cases
- /bug-reports – Documented localization issues
- TEST_PLAN.md – Overall QA approach

## Methodology
Content is evaluated for linguistic accuracy, cultural appropriateness,
clarity, consistency, and edge cases such as truncation and ambiguity.

## What I’d expand next
- Add another target language
- Introduce automation for string validation
- Expand into narrative or dialogue QA
